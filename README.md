## Generative AI Projects

* ### [Toy search app](https://github.com/Rakib-data-scientist/Toy-Search-App)

    A LLM bot that is trained on custom toy data, you can search for a toy in its UI and it will provide recommended toy.
    Basically it show the capapbility of bot to search the similar item and recommend you.

* ### [GenAI-Webdesign](https://github.com/Rakib-data-scientist/GenAI-Webdesign)

    A LLM bot that takes hand-drawn UI and can convert it into website/webdesign and also provides code.

* ### [ChatWeb](https://github.com/Rakib-data-scientist/ChatWeb)

    A LLM bot that takes an URL and a question as input and provide the result.

## Data Science Projects

* ### [Second_hand_car_price_prediction-Regression_problem](https://github.com/Rakib-data-scientist/Second_hand_car_price_prediction-Regression_problem)

    Objective : As a data scientist the objective is to predict the car price of used vehicles listings from Craigslist.org
	Context : Craigslist is the world's largest collection of used vehicles for sale
	Content : This is a Kaggle dataset which can be found in this link: https://www.kaggle.com/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data

* ### [Heart_Disease-Classification_problem](https://github.com/Rakib-data-scientist/Heart_Disease-Classification_problem)

    A project that makes a data analysis and creates a model for classification of cardiovascular disease.
	Currently, the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease is made manually by a team of specialists. The current accuracy of the diagnosis varies between 55% and 65%, due to the complexity of the diagnosis and also the fatigue of the team who take turns to minimize the risks.The cost of each diagnosis, including equipment and analysts' payroll, is around $ 1,000.00.

* ### [customer_segmentation_clustering-problem](https://github.com/Rakib-data-scientist/customer_segmentation_clustering-problem/tree/main)

    Objective : In this project, we will analyze a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories for internal structure. One goal of this project is to best describe the variation in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with. Doing so would equip the distributor with insight into how to best structure their delivery service to meet the needs of each customer.
	Context : Unsupervised Learning
	Content : The dataset for this project can be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.


* ### [Sales-Forecasting](https://github.com/Rakib-data-scientist/Sales-Forecasting)

    Objective :Time series analysis and forecasting for furniture sales.
	Content:Time Series Forecasting
	Context :Time series analysis comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. Time series forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values.

Time series are widely used for non-stationary data, like economic, weather, stock price, and retail sales in this post.
	
## Data Analysis Projects

* ### [Annual Recycled Energy](https://github.com/Rakib-data-scientist/Annual-Recycled-Energy-Data_Analysis)

	In this project, we will clean our data and prepares for data analysis. We will be using Singapore NEA Energy Savings | Kaggle data to analyze the total garbage collection and recycling rate. The material names are different as these data were collected from different resources. We will be added the latest data of 2020 waste-statistics-and-overall-recycling from the website so that we can have the latest statics analysis. We will be finding how much energy we can produce using Greentumble key information.

## Blog Posts

* ### [STATISTICS FOR DATA SCIENCE](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/statistics-for-data-science-f6ca0e0ee30f)

    In the post "STATISTICS FOR DATA SCIENCE", I wrote about statistics that is the bedrock of data science. It equips us with the tools and methods to extract insights, test hypotheses, and draw meaningful conclusions from data. Through this blog, we have explored key statistical concepts and techniques that are vital for any data scientist's toolkit.

* ### [GENETIC ALGORITHM](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/genetic-algorithm-494ac5be18bb)

    Genetic Algorithms offer a remarkable approach to problem-solving and optimization by mimicking the process of natural selection and evolution. Their ability to efficiently explore vast solution spaces and adapt to changing conditions makes them a valuable tool in the realm of data science, optimization, and machine learning
